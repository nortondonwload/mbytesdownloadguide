When You Might Need to Reinstall Malwarebytes
---------------------------------------------

There are several reasons you might need to reinstall Malwarebytes Premium:

- You bought a new computer or device.
- You reset or formatted your system.
- You removed Malwarebytes for troubleshooting and now want to reinstall it.
- You accidentally uninstalled it.
- Malware or system errors required a fresh install.

Whatever the reason, you won‚Äôt need to repurchase the software ‚Äî your license key allows you to reinstall and continue your protection.

Step-by-Step: How to Reinstall or Install Malwarebytes Premium
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Step 1: Locate Your Malwarebytes License Key**

Before installing Malwarebytes Premium, you'll need your license key. This was sent to you via email when you first purchased the product.

Look for an email with the subject line similar to:

- ‚ÄúYour Malwarebytes Order Confirmation‚Äù
- ‚ÄúYour Malwarebytes Premium License Key‚Äù

The license key is typically a 20-character alphanumeric code. It may look like this::

    XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

If you bought it from a third-party vendor (like Amazon or Newegg), check your account with that vendor or your physical product packaging for the license key.

**Tip**: If you can‚Äôt find your key, you can use the Malwarebytes Support License Lookup Tool to recover it using your purchase email.

**Step 2: Download Malwarebytes**

To download Malwarebytes Premium:

1. Go to the official Malwarebytes website:  
   üëâ https://www.malwarebytes.com
2. Click on the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button. This will download the free version ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll activate Premium in the next steps.
3. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Malwarebytes.

**Step 3: Activate Premium Using Your License Key**

After installation:

1. Open Malwarebytes on your device.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
-----------------------------

üîí **Activation Failed?**

- Check for typos: Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the key.
- Correct version: Make sure you're installing the consumer version of Malwarebytes, not a business version.
- Too many devices: If you've used the license on too many devices, you may need to deactivate one via your Malwarebytes account or contact support.

üíª **Not Showing Premium?**

If your product still shows as a free version after entering the license, try restarting the software or your device. If the issue persists, double-check the license key or contact Malwarebytes Support.

Malwarebytes Premium licenses are often valid for multiple devices, depending on your plan. Just repeat the same steps:

1. Download Malwarebytes.
2. Install it on the new device.
3. Activate it with the same license key.

**Note**: If you exceed the number of allowed devices, you may need to deactivate a previous installation first.

- Keep real-time protection enabled for continuous security.
